# Fashion_MNIST-

Practise Workbook:

Image classification of Keras built-in Fashion_MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Netwrok(CNN)

The dataset contains 10 labels of different clothing types with 28x28 grayscale images.

Training set of 60000 images and test set of 10000 images

Steps involved:

1) Load the data

    a) Tuple unpacking the data into X_train, y_train and X_test, y_test
    
2) Visualize a sample training image using matplotlib

3) Pre-processing the data:

    a) Scaling
    
    b) Converting label values to categorical
    
    c) Reshaping
    
4) Model Building and Training

5) Evaluation
